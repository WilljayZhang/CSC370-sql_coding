* Query 10 had error.


-----

* Phase 4 half working.


-----
(3) Phase 5 (brief description, assessment):

* Remaining money from the donated money toward a campaign

* Student did attempt work at phase 5, but the resulting functionality
  is far too simple, and part of it contains bugs
 

-----
(4) Other comments

* Too many bugs in the program but overall structure seems okay, which
  appear to suggest the student ran out of time to debug their
  submission.
